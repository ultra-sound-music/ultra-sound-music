# FAQ

**Q: What assets can we hold in the DAO treasury?**  
A: The DAO treasury can hold any asset. Note, however, that an [Associated Token Account (ATA)](https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account) will need to be created for the "mint" of the given asset.

**Q: How do you create an ATA for a mint?**  
A: This can be accomplished via the DAO UI:

1. Go into the treasury for the given governance.
2. Click "New Account"
3. Choose "Token Account" for the account "Type"
4. Complete the rest of the fields as needed
5. Click "Create"
6. Once the ATA has been created, you can send the Token to the address of the new ATA.
